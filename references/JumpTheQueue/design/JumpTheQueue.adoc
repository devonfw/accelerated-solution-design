= Jump The Queue Project

[[project-introduction.-statement-of-purpose]]
== *1. Project Introduction. Statement of Purpose*

Existing systems to manage queues and turns consists only in the assignation of a number without any associated logic that improves user experience and give value to user and to queue owner.

Classic systems do not allow to know at what time will be each turn. In addition, clients only can consult queue status if he stays at the queue location. This provoke a bad user experience because he must to stay in the queue all waiting time. Besides, in an amount of cases, this causes that some users leave the queue because the long waiting time, provoking the loss of the sales.

Ideally the users of the queue have to be able to know at what hour could be its turn. It is very important because he can improve its time and he will need to wait in the queue and only go when its time reaches.

Besides, to facilitate that the user has not to be in the queue waiting its turn, he can consult the queue status at any device that he can have. (for example a mobile phone, tablet,  ..)

As value added, queue owners will be able to prioritize users at the queue to have the possibility of creating marketing campaigns.

A successful solution would be to improve user experience facilitating that the user has not to be in the queue waiting its turn.

[[objectives]]
== *2. Objectives*

The objectives of the project are:

* Eliminate the needed of stay waiting in a queue.
* Improve user experience, easing the access to the queue.
* The system has to be simple and easily scalable and extensible

[[first-steps-analysis]]
== *3. First Steps Analysis*

This is the link:///171124_ADCenter_JTQ_First_Steps_Analysis_Document_V1_4.pptx[First Steps Analysis] presentation used to present and validate our understanding of the User Stories and behaviour of the future solution with customer.

[[user-stories]]
== *4. User Stories*

The first objective of Jump the Queue component is to improve the time management of the user, providing the needed functionalities to do so.

The solution focus on this premise and has to facilitate the process of accessing and consulting to the queue.

Roughly, the entire process that a user will follow to obtain and consult the access code of a queue will be:

image:media/ProcessMap.png[]

The main actors that will interact with jump the queue component will be the following:

-      User: It is an internal user of the external system that creates the queue and it will have privilege access to the queue.

-      Visitor: User of the queue component that does not exist in the external system that created the queue.

-      Owner: User that manages the queue.

In the next points, we can see the details of the user stories that define the minimum functionality of Jump the Queue component.

We can see the proposed user story map at the following figure.

image:media/UserStoryMap.png[]

[[epic-1.-get-a-number]]
=== *Epic 1. Get a number*

This epic contains all needed functions that allow users to get a number for entering in the queue.

To perform this step, Jump the queue must support the following:

1º Accept terms & conditions.

2º Register for the queue. To accomplish this, the component must validate the personal information.

3º Obtain the code to access to the queue.

The user stories that define this epic are:

[[user-story-1.-accept-terms-conditions]]
==== User story 1. Accept terms & conditions

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|==================================================================================
|Story Narrative |Accept terms & conditions |Priority |5
|As |visitor  |Size |
|I need to |accept the terms and conditions of the queue |Dependency |
|So that |I can access the Jump the Queue system | |
|Acceptance Criteria a|
- The terms and conditions of the queue need to be configured by the queue owner.

- The user can read the terms and conditions statement corresponding to the queue the user is trying to access.

- The system will ask to accept the terms and conditions of the queue before generating an access code.

|So that |their validity is confirmed | |
|Acceptance Criteria a|
- Upon a queue registration request, the user receives and email with a validation code and identificator for that queue.

- The user can use the validation code to verify the email and telephone number.

- When a user uses the validation code for the first time the telephone number and email are verified. Next time the user tries to use the validation code the system will not do any action.

[[user-story-4.-register]]
==== User story 4. Register and request access

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|======================================================================================================
|Story Narrative |Register |Priority |10
|As |visitor  |Size |
|I want to |register and request an access code for the queue |Dependency | US1, US2
|So that |I can be attended in this queue | |
|Acceptance Criteria a|
- The user has to provide a new telephone number, email and name. All these fields are mandatory.

- If an email and telephone number have been already used to request access to a queue, they cannot be used again in the same queue until the user is attended. As soon as the user is attended, this user can request a new access code by providing the identificator for this queue and the associated email or telephone number.

- Upon validation of the email and telephone number, the user gets registered and is assigned an access code for the queue.

- The access code is formatted as a "Q" plus a number between 0 and 999, which is the next free number, e.g. Q001.

- The numbering starts at value 0. If the number has reached 999, the numbering continues with value 0.

|======================================================================================================

[[epic-2.-consult-the-queue]]
=== *Epic 2. Consult the queue*

This step contains all functions to consult the status of the user in the queue.

Jump the queue must support the following:

- Show people their position in the queue
- Show the estimated time to be attended

The user stories that define this epic are:

[[user-story-6.-consult-queue]]
==== User story 6. Consult Queue

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===============================================================================================================================================================================
|Story Narrative |Consult queue |Priority |10
|As |visitor or VIP user or owner |Size |
|I want to |consult the status of the queue |Dependency |
|So that |I can know who is being served, when I am expected to be served and how I will be called | |
|Acceptance Criteria a|
- The visitor and VIP users have to provide the identificator generated for this queue and the email or telephone number used to register in that queue.

- The system will respond showing the access code of the user, the name, the estimated time and the list of unattended access codes for this queue.

- The list of unattended access codes will be arranged in chronological order, placing first the priority access codes (Axxx) and then the rest of access codes (Qxxx).

- The users registered for the queue can consult the status of the queue at any moment.

- The owner of the queue can see the access code of the current turn.

|I want to |see my estimated waiting time |Dependency |
|So that |I would know when I will be attended | |
|Acceptance Criteria a|
- The system has to calculate the estimated time with the following formula: current hour + (Sum(The last ten attention time)/nº of attended turn counted)*(number of non-attended turns in the queue before this).

- The number cannot be less than a configurable value.

- The attention time is the difference between the start time and the end time.

|==================================================================================================================================================================================================================

[[epic-3.-manage-queue]]
=== *Epic 3. Manage queue*

It contains all functions that allow to manage the queue in order to configure and attend active turn.

The user stories that define this are:

[[user-story-8.-configure-queue]]
==== User story 8. Configure queue

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=============================================================================
|Story Narrative |Configure queue |Priority |5
|As |jump the queue owner of the queue |Size |

|================================================================

[[site-map]]
== *5. Site Map*

We proposed the following sitemap and screens structures to support the requirements that must fulfill the solution.

image:media/SiteMap.PNG[]

1º Log In or Register. This is the first step where a user has to either Log In to an existing account or register a new one where he/she would also have to accept the terms and coditons and prove he/she is human.

image:media/LoginRegister.PNG[]

2º Home Screen. Here you can see the current status of the queue and either log out or join the queue.

image:media/JoinQueue.png[]

3º Queue Screen. This is where you can see your number in the queue, the estimated time at which you'll be attended, which number is currently being attended and leave the queue.

image:media/Queue_Position.png[]

Finally, we have the queue management screen where the queue owner can start and stop the queue as well as pass the turn and consult general information such as how many people are still waiting, how long it takes them to attend each visitor and how long it would still take at the current rate to finish the entire queue

[[entity-relationship-diagram]]
== *6. Entity relationship diagram*

Starting from the list of user stories, we found the below entities to support them.

[[bounded-context]]
== *7. Bounded context*

In this point, we will define the bounded context of the final solution.

In the figure below we have three domains, one for each related Epic.

* Obtain Access code domain: As we saw at epic chapter, this domain contains the required logic to get a turn in the queue. The related entities are:

** Access code: It is shared with Consult queue status domain.
** Queue: It is shared by the three domains.
** Personal information
** Terms and conditions: This is shared with Manage queue domain.

* Consult queue status domain: It has the needed logic to check turn status. This is supported by the entities:

** Access Code: It is shared with Obtain access code domain.
** Queue: It is shared by the three domains.

* Manage queue domain: This domain contains all functionalities to configurate the queues and their owners.

** Queue: It is shared by the three domains.
** Terms and conditions: This is shared with Manage queue domain.
** Queue owner.

= Jump The Queue Project

[[project-introduction.-statement-of-purpose]]
== *1. Project Introduction. Statement of Purpose*

Customers value their time as much as business owners do, and existing ticket dispensers do not help caring about them. Currently, customers need to physically go to the establishment, take a number and wait for a while. Not only is this system inefficient, as customers have to book an unreasonable amount of time only to get to the shop assistant, but also a sales barrier, as many customers get discouraged and walk away, or do not even visit the shop.

Capgemini proposes an outstanding application to manage your queue. This service will contribute to a relaxed visit through your shop by prescribing customers when to approach your desk. 

This application helps you improve the customer satisfaction as it eliminates the need to stand waiting, reduces the actual and perceived wait time and improves your business image.

Capgemini only delivers user-centric and scalable applications which are easy to use and solve your problems at the same time.


[[objectives]]
== *2. Objectives*

The objectives of the project are:

* Reduce the actual and perceived waiting time.
* Improve the user experience by easing the access to the queue.
* Simplicity and scalability.


[[first-steps-analysis]]
== *3. First Steps Analysis*

This is the link:///ADCenter_JumpTheQueue_First_Steps_Analysis_V0.3.pptx[First Steps Analysis] presentation used to present and validate our understanding of the User Stories and behaviour of the future solution with customer.

[[user-stories]]
== *4. User Stories*

The first objective of Jump the Queue is to improve the time management of the user, providing the needed functionalities to do so.

The solution focuses on this premise and has to facilitate the process of accessing and consulting the queue.

Roughly, the entire process that a user will follow to obtain and consult the access code of a queue will be:

image:media/pProcessMap.png[]

The main actors that will interact with jump the queue component will be the following:

-      Visitor: User of the queue component that requests access to the queue.

-      Owner: User that manages the queue.

In the next points, we can see the details of the user stories that define the minimum functionality of Jump the Queue component.

We can see the proposed user story map at the following figure.

[[epic-1.-register-and-log-in]]
=== *Epic 1. Register and Log in*

This epic contains all needed functions that allow users to Log in if they have an account and Register if they dont.

To perform this step, Jump the queue must support the following:

[[epic-2.-join-and-consult-the-queue]]
=== *Epic 2. Join and Consult the queue*

This step contains all functions to join the queue and consult the status of the user in the queue.

Jump the queue must support the following:

- Show customers their position in the queue
- Show the estimated waiting time to be served

The user stories that define this epic are:

|So that |I  can know when I am expected to be served
|Acceptance Criteria a|
- The waiting_time is calculated as: (Sum of last X attention_times / X) * (nº of non-attended customers in queue before me).
- The attention_time is calculated as: the period between the moment the customer starts to be served and the moment the next customer is called.
- If the end time of a visitor is not set, it is not used to calculate the attention time.
- The waiting_time cannot be shorter than a configured minimum waiting_time. If that happens, the waiting_time is set to that configured minimum waiting_time.

|====================================================================================================================================================================================================================

[[user-story-8.-queue-status]]
==== User story 8. Queue status.

[cols=",",]

** the waiting time to be served (recalculated) 
** the current ticket number being served.
- The user can quit from the queue (“Leave Queue” operation) at any moment.
- Upon cancellation of the user request to join the queue, the user gets back to the home screen and the ticket number that was assigned to this user is removed from the system.
- The user can request to go back to the login screen (“Logout” button).


|=======================================================================================

|================================================================

[[site-map]]
== *5. Site Map*

We proposed the following sitemap and screen structures to support the requirements that must be fulfilled according to the solution.

image:media/SiteMap.PNG[]

1º Log In or Register. This is the first step where a user has to either Log In to an existing account or register a new one where he/she would also have to accept the terms and coditons and prove he/she is human.

image:media/LoginRegister.PNG[]

2º Home Screen. Here you can see the current status of the queue and either log out or join the queue.

image:media/JoinQueue.png[]

3º Queue Screen. This is where you can see your number in the queue, the estimated time at which you'll be attended, which number is currently being attended and leave the queue.

image:media/Queue_Position.png[]

Finally, we have the queue management screen where the queue owner can start and stop the queue as well as pass the turn and consult general information such as how many people are still waiting, how long it takes them to attend each visitor and how long it would still take at the current rate to finish the entire queue

image:media/ServeQueue.png[]

[[entity-relationship-diagram]]
== *6. Entity relationship diagram*

Starting from the list of user stories, we created the below entities to support them.

image:media/ER.png[]

Each entity will contain the following information:


.1. Visitor
It contains the personal information of the visitors who gave the permission to use it.
[cols="",options="header",]
|======================================================================================
| Attribute| Type
|id | BigInt
|modificationCounter | Int
|username(email) | EmailType
|Name | String
|password | String
|phoneNumber | TelephoneType

|================================================================================



[[bounded-context]]
== *7. Bounded context   [Outdated]*

In this point, we will define the bounded context of the final solution.

In the figure below we have three domains, one for each related Epic.

* Obtain Access code domain: As we saw at epic chapter, this domain contains the required logic to get a turn in the queue. The related entities are:

** Access code: It is shared with Consult queue status domain.
** Queue: It is shared by the three domains.
** Personal information
** Terms and conditions: This is shared with Manage queue domain.

* Consult queue status domain: It has the needed logic to check turn status. This is supported by the entities:

** Access Code: It is shared with Obtain access code domain.
** Queue: It is shared by the three domains.

* Manage queue domain: This domain contains all functionalities to configurate the queues and their owners.

** Queue: It is shared by the three domains.
** Terms and conditions: This is shared with Manage queue domain.
** Queue owner.

[[glossary-of-terms]]
== *8. Glossary of terms*

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===========================================================================================================================================================
|Term |Description
|Access code |This is the turn number assigned to a person.
|Estimated time |Stands for the time that the system calculates when the person in the queue will be attended
|Serving time |This is the time that it takes for a user to be attended. It is calculated as the difference between the start and the end of the attention

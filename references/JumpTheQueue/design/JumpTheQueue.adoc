= Jump The Queue Project

[[project-introduction.-statement-of-purpose]]
== *1. Project Introduction. Statement of Purpose*

Existing systems to manage queues and turns consists only in the assignation of a number without any associated logic that improves user experience and give value to user and to queue owner.

Classic systems do not allow to know at what time will be each turn. In addition, clients only can consult queue status if he stays at the queue location. This provoke a bad user experience because he must to stay in the queue all waiting time. Besides, in an amount of cases, this causes that some users leave the queue because the long waiting time, provoking the loss of the sales.

Ideally the users of the queue have to be able to know at what hour could be its turn. It is very important because he can improve its time and he will need to wait in the queue and only go when its time reaches.

Besides, to facilitate that the user has not to be in the queue waiting its turn, he can consult the queue status at any device that he can have. (for example a mobile phone, tablet,  ..)

As value added, queue owners will be able to prioritize users at the queue to have the possibility of creating marketing campaigns.

A successful solution would be to improve user experience facilitating that the user has not to be in the queue waiting its turn.

[[objectives]]
== *2. Objectives*

The objectives of the project are:

* Eliminate the needed of stay waiting in a queue.
* Improve user experience, easing the access to the queue.
* The system has to be simple and easily scalable and extensible

[[first-steps-analysis]]
== *3. First Steps Analysis*

This is the link:///171124_ADCenter_JTQ_First_Steps_Analysis_Document_V1_3.pptx[First Steps Analysis] presentation used to present and validate our understanding of the User Stories and behaviour of the future solution with customer.

[[user-stories]]
== *4. User Stories*

The first objective of Jump the Queue component is to improve the time management of the user, providing the needed functionalities to do so.

The solution focus on this premise and has to facilitate the process of accessing and consulting to the queue.

Roughly, the entire process that a user will follow to obtain and consult the access code of a queue will be:

image:media/ProcessMap.png[]

The main actors that will interact with jump the queue component will be the following:

-      User: It is an internal user of the external system that creates the queue and it will have privilege access to the queue.

-      Visitor: User of the queue component that does not exist in the external system that created the queue.

-      Owner: User that manages the queue.

In the next points, we can see the details of the user stories that define the minimum functionality of Jump the Queue component.

We can see the proposed user story map at the following figure.

image:media/UserStoryMap.png[]

[[epic-1.-get-a-number]]
=== *Epic 1. Get a number*

This epic contains all needed functions that allow users to get a number for entering in the queue.

As part of the process, the epic must implement:

1º Accept terms & conditions.

2º Register in the queue. As part of this process the component must validate the information.

3º Obtain the code to access the queue.

The user stories that define this are:

|================================================================

[[site-map]]
== *5. Site Map*

We proposed the following sitemap and screens structures to support the requirements that must fulfill the solution.

image:media/SiteMap.png[]

1º Select Queue. This step will not be a screen and represent the operation that a user will follow to enter to Jump the Queue.

2º Request/ Insert code. This functionality represents the process that a user has to follow to obtain a ticket number. The proposed screen will only apply to visitors users because existing users will have a direct access to step 3.

image:media/InsertCode.png[]

3º Assigned Order / Show Queue. Here, the user can consult its number and the list of people in the queue.

image:media/ShowQueue.png[]

Finally, the owner of the queue can consult and pass the turn with the consult screen and with a button at the screen or pressing a physical button.

[[entity-relationship-diagram]]
== *6. Entity relationship diagram*

Starting from the list of user stories, we found the below entities to support them.

image:media/ER.png[]

Each entity will content the following information:

|================================================================================


[[bounded-context]]
== *7. Bounded context*

In this point, we will define the bounded context of the final solution.

In the figure below we have three domains, one for each related Epic.

* Obtain Access code domain: As we saw at epic chapter, this domain contains the required logic to get a turn in the queue. The related entities are:

** Access code: It is shared with Consult queue status domain.
** Queue: It is shared by the three domains.
** Personal information
** Terms and conditions: This is shared with Manage queue domain.

* Consult queue status domain: It has the needed logic to check turn status. This is supported by the entities:

** Access Code: It is shared with Obtain access code domain.
** Queue: It is shared by the three domains.

* Manage queue domain: This domain contains all functionalities to configurate the queues and their owners.

** Queue: It is shared by the three domains.
** Terms and conditions: This is shared with Manage queue domain.
** Queue owner.

|Term |Description
|Access code |This is the turn number assigned to a person.
|Validation code |It is a code used to confirm the validity of the email or telephone number informed by the user
|Estimated time |Stands for the time that the system calculates when the person in the queue will be attended
|Attention time |This is the time that it takes for a user to be attended. It is calculated as the difference between the start and the end of the attention
